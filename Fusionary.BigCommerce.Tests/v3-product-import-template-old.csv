And then there&rsquo;s Delbert Trew who spends more time than you can imagine thinking about something very sharp indeed: barbed wire. You can&rsquo;t go past Samuel Morse, either, who was a famous portrait painter before he gave his name to the code he invented. What a genius! And we&rsquo;re pretty taken with Noel Turner, who was smart enough to get around some pretty weird New Zealand laws to invent a car that, for a while, was a huge success. As well, you&rsquo;ll find stories on a cross-dressing spy, a couple of Sydney nerds who revolutionised modern music, court illustration, big wheels, the dubious science of controlling the weather and a whole stack of other stuff.</p>
